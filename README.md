# Resume-maker-
Developed an intuitive and user-friendly Resume Maker application to assist individuals in creating professional resumes efficiently. The application provides pre-designed templates, customization options, and real-time previews to streamline the resume-building process.


# Resume Generating Bot

## Overview
The **Resume Generating Bot** is a web-based application designed to help users create professional resumes quickly and efficiently. This bot allows users to input their personal details, education, work experience, skills, and projects, select from various templates, and download their resumes in PDF or DOCX formats.

The bot also integrates Natural Language Processing (NLP) to parse free-text input, making it more flexible and user-friendly. The goal is to provide a seamless experience where users can generate resumes that are tailored to their needs.

## Features

- **User Input Form**: Simple and intuitive forms to collect user data such as:
  - Personal Information (Name, Contact, LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.)
  - Education (Degree, University, Graduation Year, etc.)
  - Work Experience (Company Name, Role, Duration, Description, etc.)
  - Skills & Certifications
  - Projects or Personal Work
  
- **Template Selection**: Multiple customizable resume templates (e.g., classic, modern, creative).
  
- **Real-time Preview**: Instant preview of the resume as the user inputs data.

- **Resume Generation**: Users can generate their resume in PDF or DOCX format.

- **Save & Edit Option**: Option to save drafts and edit them later (using SQLite or PostgreSQL).

- **Free Text Parsing** (Optional): Integration with NLP to analyze and categorize unstructured data.

- **Downloadable Resume**: Resume available for download once the user is satisfied with the generated content.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**:
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js/Angular)
  
- **Backend**:
  - Python (Flask/Django), Node.js (if using JavaScript for the backend)
  
- **Document Generation**:
  - Python libraries like `python-docx`, `pdfkit`, `WeasyPrint`

- **NLP (Optional)**:
  - NLTK, SpaCy for text parsing
  
- **Database** (Optional for saved drafts):
  - SQLite/PostgreSQL
  
- **Cloud Hosting**:
  - Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean for deployment
  
- **Version Control**:
  - Git (GitHub for collaboration)

## Requirements

### **Functional Requirements:**

- **Resume Creation**: Ability to generate resumes based on user input.
- **Customizable Templates**: Users can select from multiple templates.
- **Resume Review**: Users should be able to edit and review their resume before final generation.
- **File Formats**: Generate resumes in PDF or DOCX format.
- **Data Validation**: Ensure correct formatting for email, dates, etc.

### **Technical Requirements:**

- **Languages & Frameworks**:
  - Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js/Angular)
  - Backend: Python (Flask/Django), Node.js
  
- **Libraries/Tools**:
  - **Backend**: Flask/Django (for Python-based backend), Express.js (for Node.js)
  - **Resume Generation**: `python-docx`, `pdfkit`, `WeasyPrint`
  - **NLP (Optional)**: NLTK, SpaCy
  - **Databases**: SQLite/PostgreSQL for storing user input (optional)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/resume-generating-bot.git
cd resume-generating-bot

### 2. Install Dependencies

#### Frontend:
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

#### Backend:
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### 3. Configure Database (Optional)

If you want to enable the save/edit feature, configure your database connection (SQLite/PostgreSQL). You can skip this step if you don't require the database feature.

### 4. Start the Application

#### Frontend:
1. In the frontend directory, run:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

#### Backend:
1. In the backend directory, run:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

### 5. Access the Bot

Once both the frontend and backend are running, access the Resume Generating Bot via `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Development

### 1. Creating Templates
- Templates are stored in the `templates/` folder in the backend.
- Each template is an HTML/CSS file or a preformatted DOCX file.
- Modify or create new templates as per the needs of your users.

### 2. Resume Generation Logic
- The bot will take user input and populate the selected template using the Python `python-docx` or `pdfkit` libraries.
- Adjust the document generation logic in `resume_generator.py` in the backend.

### 3. Implementing NLP (Optional)
- Integrate NLTK or SpaCy in the backend to parse unstructured text input, extract key details, and map them to resume sections.
- Implement Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify companies, schools, roles, etc.

### 4. Real-Time Preview
- Use JavaScript (React.js or plain JavaScript) to provide a dynamic preview of the resume based on user input.

## Testing

### Unit Tests

- Write unit tests for backend functionality:
  - Test the document generation process.
  - Test edge cases (e.g., missing fields, long text, etc.).

### User Testing

- Conduct testing with a sample user group to evaluate the ease of use and design.
- Gather feedback on template styles, usability, and the resume generation process.

## Deployment

### 1. Deploy Frontend:
   - Use GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Firebase Hosting for static file hosting.

### 2. Deploy Backend:
   - Use Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean for backend hosting.

### 3. Production Environment:
   - Ensure that the application can handle high user loads (if applicable) using caching, load balancing, etc.
